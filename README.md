# Project: `wordcount-tool` - A Professional Python Package

> A robust, well-tested, and installable Python command-line tool for counting word frequencies in a text file, built following professional software engineering best practices.

[cite_start]This repository documents the main project for the "Advanced Python for Production Systems" module of the AI Infrastructure Engineer Roadmap[cite: 67]. The goal was not just to create a simple script, but to engineer a complete software package, starting with a professional project structure, building a robust object-oriented core, validating its correctness with a comprehensive suite of automated tests, and finally, packaging it into an installable command-line application.

## Overview

The ability to write code that works is the baseline. The ability to write code that is clean, maintainable, reusable, and reliable is what defines a professional engineer. This project was an exercise in building software with that professional standard in mind. It transforms a simple task—counting words—into a case study in modern Python development, covering project setup, object-oriented design, advanced language features, automated testing, and distribution.

## Core Features
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Core logic is encapsulated in a `WordCounter` class, making it reusable and easy to manage.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Safely handles common errors, such as a non-existent file, without crashing.
* **High Test Coverage:** A full suite of unit tests written with `pytest` ensures the code's reliability, achieving 100% test coverage.
* **Professional Project Structure:** Organized as a standard, installable Python package with clean separation of application and test code.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a simple, user-friendly CLI for running the tool directly from the terminal.

## Project Structure
The project was set up using a standard, professional blueprint that separates concerns and enables robust testing and distribution.

## Core Logic & Advanced Concepts
The "engine" of the application was built using a combination of Object-Oriented and functional programming concepts to create clean and efficient code. This included mastering:

* [cite_start]**Classes and Objects (`WordCounter`):** Using a class as a blueprint to create tangible `WordCounter` objects[cite: 85].
* [cite_start]**Encapsulation (`__init__` & `self`):** Using the constructor to initialize each object's state and `self` to maintain that state across methods[cite: 73].
* [cite_start]**Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`):** Implementing these to allow our custom objects to work intuitively with built-in Python functions like `print()` and `len()`[cite: 73].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Concepts:** A deep dive into **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, **Decorators**, **Generators**, and **Context Managers (`with` statement)** to understand the full power of the Python language[cite: 73, 74].

## Robustness and Automated Testing
Writing code that works is only half the battle. A professional engineer must also prove their code is reliable. This was the focus of Segment 3.

### The "Safety Net"
[cite_start]Automated tests are the safety net that catches bugs before they reach production[cite: 78]. For this project, we used **`pytest`**, the industry-standard testing framework for Python. `pytest` automatically discovers and runs our tests, providing a clear and immediate report on the health of our codebase.

### Unit Tests
We created a suite of unit tests in the `tests/test_counter.py` file. Each test is a small, focused function designed to verify one specific piece of our application's behavior. The tests cover two key scenarios:
1.  **`test_word_counting`:** This test checks the "happy path." It creates a temporary file with known content and **asserts** that the `WordCounter` class produces the exact word counts we expect.
2.  **`test_file_not_found`:** This test checks the "unhappy path." It ensures that if our `WordCounter` is given a path to a non-existent file, it handles the error gracefully and returns `None` instead of crashing.

### Test Coverage
To ensure our tests were thorough, we measured our **test coverage**. Coverage tells us what percentage of our application code was actually executed during the test run. [cite_start]Using the `pytest-cov` plugin, we achieved **100% test coverage**, meaning every single line of our `counter.py` logic is protected by our automated safety net[cite: 87].

## Installation and Usage
This tool is packaged to be easily installable via `pip`.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/wordcount-tool.git](https://github.com/your-username/wordcount-tool.git)
    cd wordcount-tool
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the tool in editable mode:**
    The `-e` flag allows you to continue developing the tool without needing to reinstall it after every change.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
4.  **Run the tool:**
    You can now use the `wordcount` command directly in your terminal, followed by the path to the file you want to analyze.
    ```bash
    wordcount /path/to/your/textfile.txt
    ```
